Concepts for serializable gateway fact extraction, selection, prepared views and
execution across extensible processing components. Examples include MCP profile/tool
routing, Jev decisions, caching, guardrails (including bring-your-own), LLM routing,
API access and WAF inspection.

- [Design](docs/DESIGN.md): responsibilities, semantics, invariants and examples.
- [Rationale](docs/RATIONALE.md): source findings, tradeoffs and open decisions.
- [BoE Coraza WAF case study](docs/case-studies/BOE-CORAZA-WAF.md): reuse boundaries, migration scope and effort estimate.

Apps contribute composable modules with explicit downstream, upstream, or host-selection
placement and typed handoff requirements.

This is a design proposal. There is no runtime implementation or stable schema yet.
